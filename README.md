I did my undergrad at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) where I majred in psychology and sociology. 
During my MAPSS year I will be completing a _thesis_ in social psychology as well as working on improving my 
_computational and quantitative skills_ to prepare for PhD study. 
During my free time I enjoy:

1. Reading 
 + mostly non-fiction
2.  Listening to podcasts 
 + anything NPR
 + true crime
3.  And going on walks
