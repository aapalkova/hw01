I did my undergrad at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) where I majred in psychology and sociology. 
During my MAPSS year I will be completing a thesis in social psychology as well as working on improving my 
computational and quantitative skills to prepare for PhD study. 
During my free time I enjoy: 
1. reading 
2. listening to podcasts 
3. and going on walks
